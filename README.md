# India Agriculture Project

## Overview
This project analyzes agricultural data from India to understand production trends, crop distribution, and key influencing factors. The notebook (`india-agriculture.ipynb`) includes data exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling for agricultural insights.

## Dataset
The dataset typically contains attributes such as:
- Crop type
- State/Region
- Season
- Area of cultivation
- Production volume

The goal is to analyze agricultural performance and identify significant trends or patterns.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Data cleaning and formatting
   - Feature selection

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Crop-wise production analysis
   - State/region-wise comparisons
   - Seasonal patterns
   - Visualization of agricultural data

3. **Modeling (if applied)**
   - Machine learning models for yield/production prediction
   - Evaluation using accuracy metrics

4. **Results and Insights**
   - Trends in crop production
   - Regional disparities in agriculture
   - Seasonal patterns influencing output

## Requirements
To run the notebook, install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Typical libraries include:
- Python 3.9+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   cd <repo_name>
   ```
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open and run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook india-agriculture.ipynb
   ```

## Future Work
- Incorporate time-series forecasting for crop yields.
- Include external factors such as rainfall and temperature.
- Develop a dashboard for interactive visualization.
